                <h2>NASA Picks SpaceX for Artemix Human Lunar Lander Development</h2>
                <p>NASA is getting ready to send astronauts to explore more of the Moon as part of the Artemis program, and the agency has selected SpaceX to continue development of the first commercial human lander that will safely carry the next two American astronauts to the lunar surface.</p>
                <p>The agency’s powerful Space Launch System rocket will launch four astronauts aboard the Orion spacecraft for their multi-day journey to lunar orbit. There, two crew members will transfer to the SpaceX human landing system (HLS) for the final leg of their journey to the surface of the Moon. After approximately a week exploring the surface, they will board the lander for their short trip back to orbit where they will return to Orion and their colleagues before heading back to Earth.</p>

                <h2>Mars Helicopter Ingenuity’s 3rd flight in 4K for 100 meters distance</h2>
                <p>On April 25, 2021 NASA’s Ingenuity Helicopter completed 3rd 100-meterslongwise flight sending 4K UHD images from onboard camera. There are 3 onboard 4K images from Ingenuity’s 3rd flight on Mars. For the third flight altitude is 5 meters, but increasing max airspeed from 0.5 meters per second to 2 meters per second (about 4.5 mph) as we head 50 meters (164 feet) north and return to land at Wright Brothers Field.</p>
                <p>Total flight time of about 80 seconds and a total distance of 100 meters (330 feet).</p>
                <p>While that number may not seem like a lot, consider that we never moved laterally more than about two-pencil lengths when we flight-tested in the vacuum chamber here on Earth. And while the 4 meters of lateral movement in Flight Two (2 meters out and then 2 meters back) was great, providing lots of terrific data, it was still only 4 meters.</p>
                <p>As such, Flight Three is a big step, one in which Ingenuity will begin to experience freedom in the sky.  Mounted in the helicopter’s fuselage and pointed approximately 22 degree below the horizon, Ingenuity’s high-resolution color camera contains a 4208-by-3120-pixel sensor. There is also 4K video of 2nd flight of Ingenuity on Mars (enhanced using AI Engine).</p>
